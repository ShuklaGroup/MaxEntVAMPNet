# Examples

The folders contain the codes used to run the different simulations for method comparison.

 - `pentapeptide_first_comparison`: comparison of methods (excluding MaxEnt) on WLALL peptide.
 - `pentapeptide_entropy_comparison`: comparison between MaxEnt and VAMPNet + LeastCounts on WLALL peptide.
 - `villin`: comparison between MaxEnt and VAMPNet + LeastCounts on villin headpiece protein.
